# Code scaffolding

- I use several mythology of clean code in this frontend project.


### BEM

BEM is used for methodology with SCSS format to create reusable components for this task. I follow the structure developed in the dummy files.

### Husky

Husky is used for git hook pre-commit to format all code with Prettier.

### Prettier

Using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for opinionated code formatter.
It will take care of formatting for you.
Prettier creates an abstract syntax tree from your code and uses it to write new code formatted according to a set of rules.
In addition, I check pretty before every commit by add a pre-commit hook. For more detail check package.json, husky section.

### SOLID

Regarding the `S` for `SOLID` I just tried to keep each function(component as a function as well) to
just responsible for a single task. That's why I just created a separate component for every part
and also keep it simple stupid.

## Test with Jest and Enzyme ðŸª„

You can run `yarn test`. One integration test that test all functionality in this application
